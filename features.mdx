Organize your documentation into intuitive folder structures and nested pages. You create hierarchies that mirror your project architecture, making content discovery effortless.

````bash
# Example structure in your repo
docs/
  ├── api/
  │   ├── endpoints.mdx
  │   └── auth.mdx
  └── guides/
      └── quickstart.mdx
````
  </Step>
  <Step title="Nest Pages" icon="file-plus">

## Project Management

Manage multiple projects within Ulugbek Shuxratovich by creating dedicated spaces. You assign tasks, track versions, and monitor progress directly from your docs.

```javascript
// Example: Fetch project status via API
const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/v1/projects/{projectId}', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${YOUR_API_KEY}`
  }
});
const project = await response.json();
console.log(project.status); // "active" | "archived"
```

Set milestones using the built-in timeline view, which integrates with your document updates.

## Collaboration Tools

Enable team collaboration with real-time editing, comments, and version history. You invite members, set roles, and resolve changes efficiently.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Invite Collaborators" icon="user-plus">
    Go to Settings > Members and enter email addresses. Assign roles like "Editor" or "Viewer".
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Review Changes" icon="eye">
